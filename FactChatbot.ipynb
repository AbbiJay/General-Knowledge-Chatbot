        "Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form, known as lemmas. It helps in normalizing different word forms. The Lemmatization technique used in this dataset ensures that words like \"running\" and \"ran\" are reduced to their base form, \"run\".\n",

        "### 3. Stemming\n",
